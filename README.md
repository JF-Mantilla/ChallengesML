# Challenges ML

In the dynamic field of Machine Learning (ML), I have engaged in a variety of challenges that span across different aspects of data analysis, model development, and deployment. These experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and intricacies involved in implementing ML solutions. From handling large-scale datasets and ensuring data quality to fine-tuning sophisticated algorithms and optimizing model performance, each project has offered unique hurdles and learning opportunities.

1. California Housing Regression Task

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict housing values in California using the "California Housing" dataset, which includes demographic and geographic characteristics. The methodology involves data preprocessing, implementing various algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and evaluating model performance using RMSE and cross-validation.

Random Forest emerged as the most effective model, but further improvements could be made with additional testing and hyperparameter tuning. The project faced limitations due to long execution times and hardware constraints, suggesting that future work should leverage cloud computing for better efficiency and performance.

2. NYC Airbnb Rental Price Regression

We analyzed an Airbnb dataset from New York, removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values. We conducted exploratory analysis, identifying price patterns based on room type and neighborhood group. We evaluated regression models to predict prices, including Ridge, Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Ridge optimization with GridSearchCV. The optimized Ridge model, with 'alpha' of 1.0 and 'solver' 'sag', achieved an RMSE of 198.50 and an R2 of 0.109, indicating limited accuracy in predicting prices based on the available features.
